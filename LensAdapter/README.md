OpenSourceLabEquipment: Lend adapter
======================
Lens adapter is a very simple piece to enable mounting of small lenses to bigger apertures, such as in the default case mounting a 25mm lens to an IR camera with 40mm aperture.

The design if fully customizable, dimensions can be adjusted accordingly. The 3D printing time of the default configured part is 10 minutes.
