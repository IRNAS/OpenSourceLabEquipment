OpenSourceLabEquipment: Tripod Mount
======================

This Tripod Mount is designed to be used with Hama "Star 61" Tripod, to be used instead of the original base-plate for mounting custom parts. As configured in this release, it is designed to be used with green laser pointers commonly available on the market. Install it using a zip-tie. If used with batteries in the enclosure and push-button, simply rotate the laser in the mount so the button remains pressed.
